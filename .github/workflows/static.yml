# Based on https://github.com/Scony/godot-gdscript-toolkit/blob/master/action.yml
# In theory I could just copy this one:
# See https://github.com/lampe-games/godot-open-rts/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yml
# But that pulls from the "released" version, not direct from git master,
# and currently I want the lateast as only it supports all Godot 4.2 GDscript features

# Also my command lines skips the addons folder which I don't want to format.
